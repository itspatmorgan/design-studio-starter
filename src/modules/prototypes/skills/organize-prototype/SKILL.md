# Organize a prototype

Use `pnpm studio context src/prototypes/<key>/<id> --json` to inspect assignment, rebuild, and contributor scope. Inspect metadata and incoming links before structural changes. Read the relevant [prototype contract](../../README.md) sections for the requested operation.

For rename or move, update folder paths, metadata ordering, and internal links together. Report external incoming links for their owners to update. For duplication, preserve the source and operate in the new exploration; a requested system rebuild follows [build-prototype](../build-prototype/SKILL.md).

The running dev server repairs known internal references for app moves and identifiable filesystem renames. Check the result before making further replacements; avoid applying the same relative-path rewrite twice. For offline moves or dynamic paths, update references explicitly. Automatic repair does not update incoming links in another prototype.

## Archive or restore

Read the prototype contract's [archiving and deployment definition](../../README.md#archiving-and-deployment) before changing publication status. It owns status values, scope, and exclusion behavior.

- Prefer archiving when the person wants to set work aside for later. Delete only when requested.
- Archive or restore the whole prototype using its metadata or local controls. Do not invent per-artifact status fields.
- Check active links before archiving and resolve warnings about excluded targets.
- Apply the [contributor scope](../../../../platform/context/contributor-scope.md).

The [Prototypes chapter](../../../documentation/pages/prototypes.md#make-changes-safely) explains the local controls when the Guide is enabled.

## Verify

Check navigation, retained links, and requested publication status. Follow the platform working context for build and commit requirements. Report preserved originals and any unresolved incoming links.
