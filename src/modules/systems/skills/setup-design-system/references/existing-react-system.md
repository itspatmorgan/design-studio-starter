title: Assess an existing React system
description: Evaluate components, theme, and assets before proposing a maintainable import.

## Gather evidence

Ask for the accessible source repository, folder, or package and the first intended prototype. Inspect JSX or TSX, re-exports, type definitions, package metadata, and existing stories or examples. Do not modify production source during assessment.

Trace the dependencies of selected components rather than scanning an entire product indiscriminately. Include CSS imports, theme providers, fonts, icons, assets, build aliases, and runtime requirements.

Identify dependencies on routing, authentication, data fetching, application stores, environment variables, server code, and production services. Distinguish reusable interface components from product containers that orchestrate those services.

## Preserve the contract

Record exports and props, including defaults, variants, controlled state, callbacks, refs, children, and composition. For JavaScript components without types, use source and observed usage; label anything not established by evidence.

Record theme values, modes, typography, font weights, spacing, states, responsive behavior, and required providers. Locate actual font and icon sources. A similar font or approximate palette is a fidelity difference, not an exact match.

Compare source examples with the imported result under the same mode, viewport, state, and content. API compatibility includes callback and interaction behavior; matching prop names alone is insufficient.

## Propose the smallest maintainable import

Classify selected material:

| Outcome | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Portable | Connect the package or import source with required dependencies. |
| Bounded adaptation | Specify a small provider, alias, or scoped styling change and its fidelity implications. |
| Application-coupled | Prefer an existing presentation layer or ask the engineer for a reusable boundary. |
| Unverified | State missing evidence and what would establish compatibility. |

Do not reproduce a production backend, install a chain of service shims, or silently change the component API to make an import compile. Explain the blocker and propose a smaller first subset. Keep prototype data simulation at the prototype boundary where possible.

Report proposed components, theme, assets, dependencies, adaptations, and the verification plan. Include source revision and known differences. Recommend package reuse when compatible and maintainable; source copying needs a clear update path.

## Verify an authorized import

Return to Setup Design System to integrate the agreed subset. Verify representative variants, interactions, pop-ups, and supported modes against source evidence. Record API, theme, and behavior differences separately. Identify unresolved differences and make the result reviewable by the engineer providing the system.
