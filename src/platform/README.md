# Design Studio platform

The platform connects prototypes, modules, and design systems. Start here to find its knowledge, workflows, and implementation.

## Context

- [Principles](context/principles.md) and [Personas](context/personas.md): product direction and intended users.
- [Working in Studio](context/working-in-studio.md) and [Contributor scope](context/contributor-scope.md): standing requirements for agent work and preserving ownership.
- [Documentation standards](context/documentation-standards.md): writing, metadata, and verification.
- [Responsibilities](context/contracts-and-instructions.md) and [Agent context routing](context/agent-context.md): ownership and discovery, respectively.

All platform knowledge and requirements live together in `context/`:

| Subject | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration and roles | [Studio configuration](context/config.md) |
| Modules and extensions | [Modules and extensions](context/modules.md) |
| File formats and lifecycle | [File types](context/file-types.md) |
| Identity foundation and staged rollout | [Resource identity](context/resource-identity.md) |
| Editing and saving | [Editing and saving](context/source.md) |
| Assets and fonts | [Assets and fonts](context/assets.md) |
| Validation and recovery | [Checks and fixes](context/checks.md) |
| Deployment | [Publishing](context/publishing.md) |
| Shared diagram rendering | [Diagrams and code formatting](context/diagrams.md) |
| Implementation dependencies | [Technology stack](context/stack.md) |

## Skills

- [Configure studio](skills/configure-studio/SKILL.md): configure a running studio.
- [Setup contributor](skills/setup-contributor/SKILL.md): join an existing studio.
- [Manage modules](skills/manage-modules/SKILL.md): install or change capability availability.
- [Maintain context](skills/maintain-context/SKILL.md): author shared knowledge and procedures.
- [Maintain documentation](skills/maintain-documentation/SKILL.md): revise READMEs, coordinate Manual updates, and audit consistency.
- [Check design system](skills/check-design-system/SKILL.md): review a surface against its applicable design system using source checks and rendered evidence.

## Maintain the instruction set

Choose the owner, edit its canonical context or skill, and update its README and callers. Synchronize project skill exposure after skill or availability changes, then validate the result. The browser and generated harness entries consume these files; they are not separate authoring locations.

- **Responsibilities** defines ownership and authoritative locations.
- **Documentation standards** defines writing and metadata.
- **Agent context routing** defines discovery and synchronization.

Use existing commands for repeatable mechanics and skills for decisions and outcome review. [Documentation standards](context/documentation-standards.md#divide-skills-and-code) defines this boundary; [Agent context routing](context/agent-context.md#resolve-a-prototypes-system) documents read-only prototype inspection.

## Implementation

`core/` holds shared APIs and runtime boundaries. `app/` holds the application shell and shared readers. Markdown knowledge lives in Context; task procedures live in Skills.

Each module and system has its own README entry point, context, and relevant skills. A README is technical context at the owner's front door. Skills consult authoritative context rather than copying contracts.

The Documentation surface offers a curated Manual and a platform and module Context and Skills browser. The browser displays these original files. System context and skills appear within each system’s UI alongside its components and theme. Generated harness entries route agents back to the canonical skills.
