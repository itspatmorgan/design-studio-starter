// The app's front page: a greeting, a search field, and under them one small panel of what each module chooses to show
// (its `overview`, src/platform/app/modules.ts). The panel is narrow and centred, so it reads as a welcome rather
// than a page to fill, and stays comfortable in the narrow window an agent's harness gives the app. The modules decide
// what is worth showing and in what order, so a module added to the app can put something here with no change to this file.
//
// While you run the app locally it greets you and puts your own work first. The deployed site doesn't know who is
// looking, so it names the app, adds the tagline from studio.config.ts, and puts what colleagues come for first.
