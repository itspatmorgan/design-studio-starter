A canvas is a page you arrange things on. Put views from your prototype (or anyone's) side by side, add a document card, a sticky note under a screen, some text, an arrow. It's for the moments a list of pages isn't enough: showing a whole flow at once, comparing two directions, or handing someone the map before the details.

A canvas is an `.excalidraw` file, anywhere in your prototype, and it's drawn with [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com).

```text
src/prototypes/patrick/hello-world/
├── prototype.tsx
├── onboarding-flow.excalidraw   # a canvas
└── lofi/
    └── main.tsx
```

Like every file type, there's nothing to register. It appears in the prototype's navigation with a canvas icon, named from the file (`onboarding-flow.excalidraw` is "Onboarding Flow"), and opens at its path without the extension.

## Make one

Choose **+ → New canvas** next to the prototype's title, or ask your agent to make one and say what to put on it. A new canvas is empty, with a hint on how to fill it.

## What goes on it

- **Views.** Copy a view's link (right-click it in the navigation and choose **Copy link**, or copy the address from the browser), then paste it with the pointer over the canvas. It becomes a live preview of that page. Click its title bar to open it.
- **Documents and other canvases.** Paste their links too. They appear as small cards with an **Open** link.
- **Anything from other prototypes.** A link works from any contributor's prototype.
- **Notes and text.** Press **N** for a sticky note, or open the library on the right for the other colors. Double-click a note to write on it. The **A** tool adds text; the arrow tool joins things.

A canvas doesn't own what's on it, it points at it. If a file is moved or deleted, its spot shows a "Not found" card, and your agent can fix the link.

The tools in the toolbar are Excalidraw's. Its menu (the button at the bottom left, or the top left on a wide screen) has undo, redo, grid, snapping, and the background color. **⌘.** hides all the controls, for a clean view.

## With your agent

A canvas is a good place to work with your agent: to ask it to lay out a flow, put the screens of two directions side by side, or annotate what you're looking at. Your agent can see what you've selected and what's on your screen, so "this one" and "here" mean what you'd expect. It adds things while you watch, points at what it's talking about, and uses the whole of Excalidraw (boxes, arrows, colors, notes), not only screens. Each thing it does is one step you can undo with ⌘Z.

Ask for what you want in your own words. For example: "Put the checkout screens on a canvas in order, with arrows, and a note under any that has an open question."

Your agent works on the canvas whether or not you have a browser open: with the canvas open it changes it live, and without, it edits the file. You'll see changes as they're made if you have it open. Its tools are listed in `agents/rules/canvases.md`.

## Saving

While the app is running locally, a canvas saves itself a moment after you stop editing, into the file, and your agent can edit the same file: changes show up on the open canvas as they're made, and merge with yours. On the deployed site, a canvas is read-only.

You can edit only your own prototypes' canvases. Others' open in a view you can look around, but not change.

## No images

A canvas can't hold images: Excalidraw would store their bytes inside the file, and a few screenshots would swell the repository. Put the real view on the canvas instead of a picture of it.

## Not using them?

Canvases are optional for a prototype, and for the platform: delete `src/studio/fileTypes/canvas/`, and the app runs without them (and without Excalidraw). See `src/studio/fileTypes/canvas/README.md`, and `src/studio/fileTypes/README.md` for how file types work.
